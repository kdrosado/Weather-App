# Weather-App
A web application that displays the weather

Technologies used: Angular, jQuery, JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML

Note: HTTPS enforcement is required for GitHub Pages sites created after June 15, 2016 and using a github.io domain;
Since this app will work only over http and NOT https because of a http resource used in the Javascript file, I have created the project in Codepen.  To view the project there go to the following link: http://codepen.io/kdrosado/pen/RoOorB
